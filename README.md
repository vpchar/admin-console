# 1) I asked ChatGPT: Start by writing out the HTML elements for the sidebar, header and main-content containers. In your CSS file, apply Grid properties until you have this basic layout built.

It gave me the basic layut:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="sidebar">
    <!-- sidebar content goes here -->
  </div>
  <div class="header">
    <!-- header content goes here -->
  </div>
  <div class="main-content">
    <!-- main content goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
```
and css:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr; /* 200px sidebar, 1fr main content */
  grid-template-rows: 50px 1fr; /* 50px header, 1fr main content */
  grid-template-areas: 
    "sidebar header"
    "sidebar main-content";
}

.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
}

.main-content {
  grid-area: main-content;
}
```
Nice job, we will continue alone, 'cause it is not fair ;-)

# 2) Nesting from there, I built the rest as nice little layout:

It looks easier, just follow the process! Decided to end it here, because the rest is not important for me right now ;-)

Yet again, Safari (mac) doesn't work as Chrome. Don't these people know we had to test on different browsers, or is it too early for these compatibility issues to trow into the mess?
